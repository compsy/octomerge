# Octomerge
A missing button for automatic merge on build succeeds on Github

If you've reviewed a merge request, but the CI builds are still running, it can be annoying to have to wait for them to finish.

This way, you don't have to wait for the builds to finish and remember to merge the request manually. Less waiting, more reviewing!

## Auto-merge on Build Succeeds
When you hit the "Auto-merge on Build Succeeds" button, the status of the merge request will be updated to represent the impending merge. There is an option to cancel the automatic merge but only the user who initialized the auto-merge can cancel it.
