# Octomerge
A chrome browser extension to help you merge the pull requests automatically once the build succeeds on Github.

If you've reviewed a merge request, but the CI builds are still running, it can be annoying to have to wait for them to finish. Octomerge will help you merge it so that you don't have to wait for the builds to finish and remember to merge the request manually.

- No more waiting on builds succeed and merge manually
- Delete merged PRs branches or closed PRs branches for you

## Installation
- [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/octomerge/bcfdlpkdamkbcidkenogbahohlnonebo)

## Auto-merge on Build Succeeds
When you hit the "Auto-merge on Build Succeeds" button, the status of the merge request will be updated to represent the impending merge. There is an option to cancel the automatic merge but only the user who initialized the auto-merge can cancel it.
